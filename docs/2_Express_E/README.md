# Getting Started with Express.js: A Beginner's Guide

Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for building web applications. In this beginner's guide, we will cover the basics of getting started with Express.js and building a simple web application.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, you will need to have Node.js installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org). Once you have Node.js installed, you can proceed to the next step.

## Installation

To install Express.js, you can use the Node Package Manager (npm). Open your terminal or command prompt and type the following command:

```bash
npm install express
```

This will install the latest version of Express.js in your project directory.

## Creating a Basic Web Application

To create a basic web application using Express.js, you can create a new file in your project directory and name it `app.js`. In this file, you will need to import the Express.js module and create a new instance of the application.

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
```

Next, you can define a route for your application by using the `app.get()` method. This method takes two arguments: the path of the route and a callback function that will be called when the route is accessed.

```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!')
})
```

Finally, you can start the server by calling the `app.listen()` method and passing in the port number to listen on.

```javascript
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000')
})
```

Your `app.js` file should now look something like this:

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!')
})

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000')
})
```

Save the file and open your terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the directory where the `app.js` file is located and type the following command:

```bash
node app.js
```

This will start the server and your application should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we have covered the basics of getting started with Express.js and building a simple web application. We have learned how to install Express.js, create a new instance of the application, define routes, and start the server.

Express.js is a powerful framework that provides a wide range of features for building web applications. With this beginner's guide, you are now well on your way to exploring the vast world of Express.js development.

Happy coding!
